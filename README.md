# Bristol Silicon Family Tree

This document originated Will Robins, many thanks to him for the effort
involved in putting it together.

This tree contains the relationships between the many companies 
involved in the silicon and EDA industry in Bristol, UK. There is a rich
and complex history to the industry in the city, ideas have developed
across and throughout the lifespan of these many organisations that 
continue to flourish to this day.
